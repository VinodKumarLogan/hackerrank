Sunny and Johnny together have M dollars which they intend to use at the ice cream parlour. Among N flavors available, they have to choose two distinct flavors whose cost equals M. Given a list of cost of N flavors, output the indices of two items whose sum equals M. The cost of a flavor (ci) will be no more than 10000.

Input Format

The first line of the input contains T, T test cases follow. 
Each test case follows the format: The first line contains M. The second line contains the number N. The third line contains N single space separated integers denoting the price of each flavor ci.

Output Format

Output two integers, each of which is a valid index of the flavor. The lower index must be printed first. Indices are indexed from 1 to N.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 50 
2 ≤ M ≤ 10000 
2 ≤ N ≤ 10000 
1 ≤ ci ≤ 10000 
The prices of two items may be same and each test case has a unique solution.
