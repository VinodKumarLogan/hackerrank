You are given a series, whose nth term is defined as

Tn = n^2 - (n-1)^2

You have to find the Sum of the series Sn = T1 + T2 + T3 + .... + Tn

Find Sn % (10^9 + 7)

Input Format

First line contains T, denoting the number of testcases. 
Each Test case contains 1 line 
n

Output Format

Print the required sum % (10^9 + 7)

Constraints

1 <= T <= 10 
1 <= n <= 10^16
