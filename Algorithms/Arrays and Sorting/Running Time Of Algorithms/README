Challenge 
Can you modify your previous Insertion Sort implementation to keep track of the number of shifts it makes while sorting? The only thing you should print is the number of shifts made by the insertion sort algorithm to completely sort the array. A shift occurs when an element's position changes in the array. (Do not shift an element if it is not necessary.)

Input Format 
The first line contains N, the number of elements to be sorted. The next line contains N integers a[1],a[2]...,a[N].

Output Format 
Output the number of shifts it takes.

Constraints 
1<=N<=1001 
-10000 <= x <= 10000 , x âˆˆ a
