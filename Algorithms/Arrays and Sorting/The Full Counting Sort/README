In the previous challenge, you created a "helper array" that contains information about the starting position of each element in a sorted array. Can you use this array to help you create a sorted array of the original list?

Hint: You can go through the original array to access the strings. You can then use your helper array to help determine where to place those strings in the sorted array. Be careful about being one off.

Details and a Twist 
You will be given a list that contains both integers and strings. Can you print the strings in order of their accompanying integers? If the integers for two strings are equal, ensure that they are print in the order they appeared in the original list.

The Twist - Your clients just called with an update. They don't want you to print the first half of the original array. Instead, they want you to print a dash for any element from the first half. So you can modify your counting sort algorithm to sort the second half of the array only.

Input Format 
n - the size of the list ar. 
n lines follow, each containing an integer x, and a string, s.

Output Format 
Print the strings in their correct order.

Constraints 
1 <= n <= 1000000 
n is even 
1 <= length(s) <= 10 
0 <= x < 100 , x âˆˆ ar 
The characters in every string s is in lowercase.
