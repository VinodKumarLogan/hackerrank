You're given an array ar and a number p. Partition the array, so that, all elements greater than p are to its right, and all elements smaller than p are to its left.

In the new sub-array, the relative positioning of elements should remain the same, i.e., if n1 was before n2 in the original array, it must remain before it in the sub-array. The only situation where this does not hold good is when p lies between n1 and n2

i.e., n1 > p > n2.

Guideline - In this challenge, you do not need to move around the numbers 'in-place'. This means you can create 2 lists and combine them at the end.

Input Format 
You will be given an array of integers. The number p is the first element in ar.

There are 2 lines of input:

n - the number of elements in the array ar
the n elements of ar (including p at the beginning)
Output Format 
Print out the numbers of the partitioned array on one line.

Constraints 
1<=n<=1000 
-1000<=x<= 1000 , x âˆˆ ar 
All elements will be distinct
