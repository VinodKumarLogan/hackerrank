Given a sorted list with an unsorted number V in the right-most cell, can you write some simple code to insert V into the array so it remains sorted?

Print the array every time a value is shifted in the array until the array is fully sorted. The goal of this challenge is to follow the correct order of insertion sort.

Guideline: You can copy the value of V to a variable, and consider its cell "empty". Since this leaves an extra cell empty on the right, you can shift everything over until V can be inserted. This will create a duplicate of each value, but when you reach the right spot, you can replace a value with V.

Input Format 
There will be two lines of input:

s - the size of the array
ar - the sorted array of integers
Output Format 
On each line, output the entire array every time an item is shifted in it.

Constraints 
1<=s<=1000 
-10000<=x<= 10000, x âˆˆ ar
